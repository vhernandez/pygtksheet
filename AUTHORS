Víctor M. Hernández-Rocamora is the mantainer of the GtkSheet python
bindings. 

These bindings are based on the python bindings for the 
GtkExtra library, written by Toby D. Reeves and Andreas Voegele.

From the python-gtkextra2 AUTHORS:

Andreas Voegele wrote the python bindings for GtkExtra-0.99.x
under PyGtk-1 and Gtk-1.2. He has since left the project.

Toby D. Reeves <treeves@users.sourceforge.net> wrote the python
bindings for GtkExtra-2 under PyGtk-2 and Gtk-2.x. This is an
almost complete rewrite with very little of Andreas' C code left.
